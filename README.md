# Gridiron Concentration Game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Concentration, also known as "Match Match", "Match Up", "Memory", "Pelmanism", "Shinkei-suijaku", "Pexeso" or simply "Pairs", is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

## How to play
- You will start by flipping over one card.
- If the next card you flip matches, you get +1 to your score.
- These cards then disappear.
- If the next card you flip does not match the cards flip back.
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
